## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

most likely in Bronx, Coney Island and Harlem 


2. Trend related to the news

last week was a shooting in Brooklyn on ave U and e 15th street, one police officer got injured!

3. Who does that?

well this question could be interpreted in so many different wasy, I think, people who has mental problems do a crime!


4. Answering a question people care about
I think its good to be informed how bad or how good the area you are trying to move in, hopefully they care!

5. Valuable to businesses

not sure if crime could be valuable to business or not.

most likely crime could destroy buisnesess, for instatnce I know that a grocery store in neighbour was robbed 

so this kind of acts definetly hits the financial part.

the only postive thing of crime I could think distrubiting drugs could make millions of money


6. What's the most popular?

well i could think of Ted Bundy the most popular serial killer, kindpeper, raper! 
7. Cost/Money rankings

it oculd cost a lots of money, for example hitman gets paid a lot to kill a target. This called contract killer it is a kind of form of murderer
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Maybe that the crime is often associated with mental disorder to lessen the crime for the plaintiff

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

there is one that is really atracts me attention i found it in reddit, the topic is 
"What happens to the plasctic We Throw Out"

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

"If we eliminate use of plastic, then the world could reapir itself faster"

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Does eliminating plastic has other effects to the world?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data
